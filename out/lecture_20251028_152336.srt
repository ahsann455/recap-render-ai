# Introduction to Linear Regression.

2
00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:05,265
- What is linear regression?

3
00:00:05,265 --> 00:00:09,214
- Why it matters: prediction and interpretation.

4
00:00:09,214 --> 00:00:15,220
- Core assumptions: linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, normality.

5
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:16,260
## The Model.

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:25,625
We model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables using a linear equation.

7
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:26,585
- Simple vs.

8
00:00:26,585 --> 00:00:28,106
multiple regression

9
00:00:28,106 --> 00:00:31,308
- Parameters: intercept and coefficients

10
00:00:31,308 --> 00:00:34,829
- Error term represents unexplained variance

11
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:38,248
## Fitting and Evaluation.

12
00:00:38,248 --> 00:00:42,192
- Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)

13
00:00:42,192 --> 00:00:44,559
- Train/test split

14
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,451
- R-squared, RMSE, MAE

15
00:00:47,451 --> 00:00:49,949
- Residual analysis
