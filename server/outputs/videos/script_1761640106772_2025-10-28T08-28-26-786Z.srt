00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
Good morning, class..

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:06,072
Today, we're going to explore the fascinating world of calculus.

3
00:00:06,072 --> 00:00:08,287
(write "Calculus" on the board)

4
00:00:08,287 --> 00:00:11,359
Calculus is the study of how things change.

5
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:16,646
It helps us analyze motion, growth, decay, optimization, and accumulation.

6
00:00:16,646 --> 00:00:26,719
(underline "change" on the board) Think about it - everything around us is changing, from the motion of objects to the growth of populations.

7
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:31,649
Calculus gives us the tools to understand and describe these changes.

8
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:38,364
There are two main ideas in calculus: (write "Differentiation" and "Integration" on the board)

9
00:00:38,364 --> 00:00:39,164
1.

10
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:43,880
**Differentiation**: This is all about finding the rate of change.

11
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:54,096
(draw an arrow on the board to represent change) For example, if we know the position of an object, differentiation helps us find its velocity.

12
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:59,240
Mathematically, this is represented by the derivative, denoted as 𝑓′(𝑥).

13
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:05,098
(write the derivative formula on the board: 𝑓′(𝑥) = lim⁡ℎ → 0 [𝑓(𝑥 + ℎ) - 𝑓(𝑥)]/ℎ)

14
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:07,384
Let's consider a simple example.

15
00:01:07,384 --> 00:01:14,600
(write 𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑥² on the board) If we want to find the derivative of this function, we get 𝑓′(𝑥) = 2𝑥.

16
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:20,887
(write the derivative on the board) This tells us the slope of the curve at any point 𝑥.

17
00:01:20,887 --> 00:01:21,687
2.

18
00:01:21,687 --> 00:01:26,402
**Integration**: This is all about finding the total accumulation.

19
00:01:26,402 --> 00:01:33,547
(draw a curve on the board to represent accumulation) Think of it as finding the area under a curve.

20
00:01:33,547 --> 00:01:41,048
(shade the area under the curve) Mathematically, this is represented by the integral, denoted as ∫𝑓(𝑥)𝑑𝑥.

21
00:01:41,048 --> 00:01:47,335
(write the definite integral formula on the board: ∫𝑎ⁿ𝑓(𝑥)𝑑𝑥 = lim⁡𝑛 → ∞ ∑𝑖=1ⁿ 𝑓(𝑥𝑖∗)Δ𝑥)

22
00:01:47,335 --> 00:01:57,694
These two branches of calculus - differential calculus and integral calculus - are fundamental to understanding how things change and accumulate.

23
00:01:57,694 --> 00:02:10,625
(underline "calculus" on the board again) Throughout this course, we'll be exploring these concepts in more depth, and I encourage you to ask questions and engage with the material.

24
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:15,169
Thank you for your attention, and let's get started on this journey into calculus!
