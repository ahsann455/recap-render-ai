Calculus is the study of how things change. It helps us analyze motion, growth, decay, optimization, and accumulation. There are two main ideas: Differentiation → finding the rate of change (like velocity from position). Integration → finding the total accumulation (like distance from velocity). ⚙️ 2. The Two Branches of Calculus (a) Differential Calculus Focuses on how a quantity changes. The main concept is the derivative. For a function 𝑓 ( 𝑥 ) f(x), the derivative 𝑓 ′ ( 𝑥 ) f ′ (x) tells us how fast 𝑓 f changes with respect to 𝑥 x. Mathematically: 𝑓 ′ ( 𝑥 ) = lim ⁡ ℎ → 0 𝑓 ( 𝑥 + ℎ ) − 𝑓 ( 𝑥 ) ℎ f ′ (x)= h→0 lim ​ h f(x+h)−f(x) ​ Example: If 𝑓 ( 𝑥 ) = 𝑥 2 f(x)=x 2 , then 𝑓 ′ ( 𝑥 ) = 2 𝑥 f ′ (x)=2x. This means the slope of 𝑦 = 𝑥 2 y=x 2 at any point 𝑥 x is 2 𝑥 2x. (b) Integral Calculus Focuses on the total or accumulated change. The main concept is the integral. It can be thought of as the area under the curve of a function. Mathematically (for the definite integral): ∫ 𝑎 𝑏 𝑓 ( 𝑥 ) 𝑑 𝑥 = lim ⁡ 𝑛 → ∞ ∑ 𝑖 = 1 𝑛 𝑓 ( 𝑥 𝑖 ∗ ) Δ 𝑥 ∫ a b ​ f(x)dx= n→∞ lim ​ i=1 ∑ n ​ f(x i ∗ ​ )Δx
