Welcome, students. Today, we're going to explore the fascinating world of calculus. (write "Calculus" on the board)

Calculus is essentially the study of how things change. It helps us analyze motion, growth, decay, optimization, and accumulation. (write these key concepts on the board) You can think of it like this: imagine you're on a road trip, and you want to know your speed at any given moment, or the total distance you've traveled. Calculus is the tool that helps you figure that out.

Now, there are two main branches of calculus: Differential Calculus and Integral Calculus. (write these two branches on the board)

Let's start with Differential Calculus. (underline "Differential Calculus") This branch focuses on how a quantity changes. The main concept here is the derivative. (write "Derivative" on the board) For a function f(x), the derivative f'(x) tells us how fast f changes with respect to x. Mathematically, it's represented as: (write the derivative formula on the board)

f'(x) = lim(h → 0) [f(x + h) - f(x)]/h

Let's use a simple example to illustrate this. (write the example on the board) If f(x) = x^2, then f'(x) = 2x. This means the slope of the curve y = x^2 at any point x is 2x.

Now, let's move on to Integral Calculus. (underline "Integral Calculus") This branch focuses on the total or accumulated change. The main concept here is the integral. (write "Integral" on the board) You can think of it as the area under the curve of a function. Mathematically, it's represented as: (write the definite integral formula on the board)

∫[a, b] f(x) dx = lim(n → ∞) ∑[f(x_i*) Δx]

In essence, the integral calculates the total accumulation of a quantity over a given interval.

So, to recap, (write "Key Takeaways" on the board) Differential Calculus helps us find the rate of change, while Integral Calculus helps us find the total accumulation. Both are essential tools for understanding how things change, and they have numerous applications in physics, engineering, economics, and more.

I hope this introduction to calculus has sparked your interest, and I'm excited to explore more topics with you throughout this course. Do you have any questions so far?
