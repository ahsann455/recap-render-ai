Good morning, class. Today, we're going to explore the fascinating world of calculus. (write "Calculus" on the board) Calculus is the study of how things change. It helps us analyze motion, growth, decay, optimization, and accumulation. 

Let's break it down into two main ideas. (draw a diagram with two branches) On one hand, we have differentiation, which is all about finding the rate of change. Think of it like velocity - if you know the position of an object, differentiation helps you find its velocity. (write "Differentiation" on one branch) On the other hand, we have integration, which is about finding the total accumulation. For example, if you know the velocity of an object, integration helps you find the distance it has traveled. (write "Integration" on the other branch)

Now, let's dive deeper into these two branches. (point to the differentiation branch) Differential calculus focuses on how a quantity changes. The main concept here is the derivative. (write "Derivative" on the board) For a function f(x), the derivative f'(x) tells us how fast f changes with respect to x. Mathematically, this can be represented as (write the limit formula for the derivative on the board): 

f'(x) = lim(h → 0) [f(x + h) - f(x)]/h

Let's consider an example. If f(x) = x^2, then f'(x) = 2x. (write the example on the board) This means the slope of the curve y = x^2 at any point x is 2x.

Moving on to the other branch, (point to the integration branch) integral calculus focuses on the total or accumulated change. The main concept here is the integral. (write "Integral" on the board) Think of it as the area under the curve of a function. Mathematically, this can be represented as (write the definite integral formula on the board):

∫[a, b] f(x) dx = lim(n → ∞) Σ[f(x_i*) Δx]

In summary, (draw a diagram summarizing the two branches) calculus is the study of how things change, with two main branches: differential calculus, which focuses on the rate of change, and integral calculus, which focuses on the total accumulation. Both concepts are crucial in understanding and analyzing real-world phenomena. (look around the class) I hope this introduction to calculus has sparked your interest, and we'll be exploring more of these concepts in our upcoming lectures.
