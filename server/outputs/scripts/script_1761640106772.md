Good morning, class. Today, we're going to explore the fascinating world of calculus. (write "Calculus" on the board)

Calculus is the study of how things change. It helps us analyze motion, growth, decay, optimization, and accumulation. (underline "change" on the board) Think about it - everything around us is changing, from the motion of objects to the growth of populations. Calculus gives us the tools to understand and describe these changes.

There are two main ideas in calculus: (write "Differentiation" and "Integration" on the board)

1. **Differentiation**: This is all about finding the rate of change. (draw an arrow on the board to represent change) For example, if we know the position of an object, differentiation helps us find its velocity. Mathematically, this is represented by the derivative, denoted as 𝑓′(𝑥). (write the derivative formula on the board: 𝑓′(𝑥) = lim⁡ℎ → 0 [𝑓(𝑥 + ℎ) - 𝑓(𝑥)]/ℎ)

Let's consider a simple example. (write 𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑥² on the board) If we want to find the derivative of this function, we get 𝑓′(𝑥) = 2𝑥. (write the derivative on the board) This tells us the slope of the curve at any point 𝑥.

2. **Integration**: This is all about finding the total accumulation. (draw a curve on the board to represent accumulation) Think of it as finding the area under a curve. (shade the area under the curve) Mathematically, this is represented by the integral, denoted as ∫𝑓(𝑥)𝑑𝑥. (write the definite integral formula on the board: ∫𝑎ⁿ𝑓(𝑥)𝑑𝑥 = lim⁡𝑛 → ∞ ∑𝑖=1ⁿ 𝑓(𝑥𝑖∗)Δ𝑥)

These two branches of calculus - differential calculus and integral calculus - are fundamental to understanding how things change and accumulate. (underline "calculus" on the board again) Throughout this course, we'll be exploring these concepts in more depth, and I encourage you to ask questions and engage with the material. Thank you for your attention, and let's get started on this journey into calculus!
