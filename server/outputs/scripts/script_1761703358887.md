Welcome, students. Today, we're going to explore the fascinating world of calculus. (write "Calculus" on the board)

Calculus is essentially the study of how things change. It helps us analyze motion, growth, decay, optimization, and accumulation. (underline "change" on the board) You can think of it like this: imagine you're driving a car. Calculus helps you understand your velocity, or how fast you're moving, as well as the total distance you've traveled.

Now, there are two main branches of calculus: Differential Calculus and Integral Calculus. (write "Two Branches of Calculus" on the board and list the two branches)

Let's start with Differential Calculus. (circle "Differential Calculus") This branch focuses on how a quantity changes. The main concept here is the derivative. (write "Derivative" on the board) For a function f(x), the derivative f'(x) tells us how fast f changes with respect to x. (write the derivative formula on the board: f'(x) = lim(h→0) [f(x+h) - f(x)]/h)

For example, if we have the function f(x) = x^2, (write the function on the board) then the derivative f'(x) = 2x. (write the derivative on the board) This means that the slope of the curve y = x^2 at any point x is 2x.

Now, let's move on to Integral Calculus. (circle "Integral Calculus") This branch focuses on the total or accumulated change. The main concept here is the integral. (write "Integral" on the board) You can think of it as the area under the curve of a function. (draw a simple curve on the board) Mathematically, the definite integral can be represented as: (write the integral formula on the board: ∫[a,b] f(x) dx = lim(n→∞) ∑[f(x_i*) Δx])

In summary, (write "Summary" on the board) Differential Calculus helps us find the rate of change, or the derivative, while Integral Calculus helps us find the total accumulation, or the integral. (underline "rate of change" and "total accumulation" on the board) Both of these concepts are crucial in understanding how things change, and they have numerous applications in physics, engineering, economics, and more.

I hope this introduction to calculus has sparked your interest, and I'm excited to explore more topics with you throughout the semester. Do you have any questions so far?
