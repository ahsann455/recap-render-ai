Welcome, students. Today, we're going to explore the fascinating world of calculus. (write "Calculus" on the board)

Calculus is essentially the study of how things change. It helps us analyze motion, growth, decay, optimization, and accumulation. (write these key concepts on the board) Think about it - whether it's the motion of an object, the growth of a population, or the optimization of a system, calculus provides us with the tools to understand and describe these changes.

Now, there are two main branches of calculus: Differential Calculus and Integral Calculus. (draw a diagram with two branches on the board)

Let's start with Differential Calculus. (write "Differential Calculus" on the board) This branch focuses on how a quantity changes. The main concept here is the derivative. (write "Derivative" on the board) For a function f(x), the derivative f'(x) tells us how fast f changes with respect to x. Mathematically, this can be represented as: (write the derivative formula on the board)

f'(x) = lim(h → 0) [f(x + h) - f(x)]/h

Let's consider an example. If f(x) = x^2, then f'(x) = 2x. (write the example on the board) This means the slope of the curve y = x^2 at any point x is 2x.

Now, let's move on to Integral Calculus. (write "Integral Calculus" on the board) This branch focuses on the total or accumulated change. The main concept here is the integral. (write "Integral" on the board) Think of it as the area under the curve of a function. Mathematically, this can be represented as: (write the definite integral formula on the board)

∫[a, b] f(x) dx = lim(n → ∞) Σ[f(x_i*) Δx]

In essence, calculus is about understanding change and accumulation. These two branches - Differential Calculus and Integral Calculus - provide us with the tools to analyze and describe the world around us. (summarize the key points on the board)

So, to recap: calculus is the study of change, with two main branches - Differential Calculus, which focuses on rates of change, and Integral Calculus, which focuses on total accumulation. (look at the students) I hope this introduction to calculus has sparked your interest, and I'm excited to explore these concepts further with you throughout the course.
