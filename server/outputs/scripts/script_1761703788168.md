Welcome, students. Today, we're going to explore the fascinating world of calculus. (write "Calculus" on the board)

Calculus is essentially the study of how things change. It helps us analyze motion, growth, decay, optimization, and accumulation. (write these key concepts on the board) You can think of it as a tool to understand the world around us, from the motion of objects to the growth of populations.

Now, there are two main branches of calculus: Differential Calculus and Integral Calculus. (draw a diagram with two branches on the board)

Let's start with Differential Calculus. (point to the differential calculus branch) This branch focuses on how a quantity changes. The main concept here is the derivative. (write "Derivative" on the board) For a function f(x), the derivative f'(x) tells us how fast f changes with respect to x. (write the mathematical formula for the derivative on the board)

For example, if we have the function f(x) = x^2, then the derivative f'(x) = 2x. (write the example on the board) This means the slope of the curve y = x^2 at any point x is 2x.

Now, let's move on to Integral Calculus. (point to the integral calculus branch) This branch focuses on the total or accumulated change. The main concept here is the integral. (write "Integral" on the board) You can think of it as the area under the curve of a function. (draw a curve on the board with the area shaded)

Mathematically, the definite integral can be represented as (write the mathematical formula for the definite integral on the board). This formula calculates the area under the curve by summing up the areas of tiny rectangles.

In summary, (write "Summary" on the board) calculus is the study of change, with two main branches: Differential Calculus, which focuses on the rate of change, and Integral Calculus, which focuses on the total accumulation. (point to the two branches on the board) Understanding these concepts will help you analyze and solve a wide range of problems in physics, engineering, economics, and more.

That's a brief introduction to calculus. I hope this gives you a good idea of what calculus is all about. Do you have any questions so far? (pause for questions)
