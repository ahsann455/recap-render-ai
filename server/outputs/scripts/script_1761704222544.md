Welcome, students. Today, we're going to explore the fascinating world of calculus. (write "Calculus" on the board)

Calculus is essentially the study of how things change. It helps us analyze motion, growth, decay, optimization, and accumulation. (write "Change" and "Analysis" on the board) You can think of it like this: imagine you're on a road trip, and you want to know your velocity at any given moment. Or, maybe you want to calculate the total distance you've traveled. That's where calculus comes in.

There are two main ideas in calculus: Differentiation and Integration. (write "Differentiation" and "Integration" on the board) Let's break them down.

Differentiation is all about finding the rate of change. (write "Rate of Change" on the board) It's like finding your velocity from your position. The main concept here is the derivative. (write "Derivative" on the board) For a function f(x), the derivative f'(x) tells us how fast f changes with respect to x.

(mathematically write the derivative formula on the board: f'(x) = lim(h→0) [f(x+h) - f(x)]/h)

Let's look at an example. If f(x) = x^2, then f'(x) = 2x. (write the example on the board) This means the slope of the curve y = x^2 at any point x is 2x.

Now, let's move on to Integration. (write "Integration" on the board) Integration is all about finding the total or accumulated change. It's like finding the distance you've traveled from your velocity. The main concept here is the integral. (write "Integral" on the board) You can think of it as the area under the curve of a function.

(mathematically write the definite integral formula on the board: ∫[a,b] f(x)dx = lim(n→∞) Σ[f(x_i*)Δx])

In summary, (write "Summary" on the board) Calculus is the study of change, with two main branches: Differential Calculus, which focuses on rates of change, and Integral Calculus, which focuses on total accumulation. Both are essential tools for analyzing and understanding the world around us.

That's a brief overview of calculus. I hope this gives you a good starting point for our journey into the world of calculus. Do you have any questions so far?
