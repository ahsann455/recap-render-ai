Welcome, students. Today, we're going to explore the fascinating world of calculus. (write "Calculus" on the board)

Calculus is the study of how things change. It helps us analyze motion, growth, decay, optimization, and accumulation. Think about it - everything around us is constantly changing, and calculus gives us the tools to understand and describe these changes.

There are two main ideas in calculus: (write "Differentiation" and "Integration" on the board)

1. **Differentiation**: This is all about finding the rate of change. For example, if you know the position of an object, differentiation helps you find its velocity. Mathematically, this is represented by the derivative, denoted as 𝑓′(𝑥). (write the derivative formula on the board: 𝑓′(𝑥) = lim⁡ℎ→0 [𝑓(𝑥+ℎ) - 𝑓(𝑥)]/ℎ)

Let's consider a simple example. If we have a function 𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑥², then its derivative 𝑓′(𝑥) = 2𝑥. This tells us the slope of the curve 𝑦 = 𝑥² at any point 𝑥.

2. **Integration**: This is about finding the total accumulation. If you know the velocity of an object, integration helps you find the distance traveled. Think of it as finding the area under the curve of a function. (write the integral formula on the board: ∫𝑎𝑏 𝑓(𝑥) 𝑑𝑥 = lim⁡𝑛→∞ ∑𝑖=1𝑛 𝑓(𝑥𝑖∗) Δ𝑥)

These two branches of calculus - differential calculus and integral calculus - are the foundation of our study. Differential calculus focuses on how a quantity changes, while integral calculus focuses on the total or accumulated change.

So, to recap: (summarize on the board)

* Calculus is the study of how things change
* Two main ideas: Differentiation (rate of change) and Integration (total accumulation)
* Differential calculus: derivative (𝑓′(𝑥)) represents the rate of change
* Integral calculus: integral (∫𝑎𝑏 𝑓(𝑥) 𝑑𝑥) represents the total accumulation

I hope this introduction to calculus has sparked your interest. We'll be exploring these concepts in more depth throughout the course. Do you have any questions so far?
